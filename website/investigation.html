                I started by researching on current existing designs, to see what ideas were already available, and to gain inspiration for my own.

            <p>
                From the solutions found online, many of them allow the user to log the emotions they feel.
                I wanted to build on this concept. I wanted to allow the user to not only log their emotions, but see their general emotions state throughout the day. This could possibly be done by asking the user to log their emotions at certain timestamps throughout the day. From this data gathered, it can then be plotted on a graph for easy visibility.

                <br><br>

                I wanted to also allow the user to input "how intense" they feel a certain emotion.
                This is because people don't just feel a certain emotion. For example, some may fee very happy, and some may feel only just a bit happy.
