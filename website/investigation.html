        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
            I started by researching on current existing designs, to see what ideas were already available, and to gain inspiration for my own.

        <h3>Free Solutions</h3>
        <p>
            After seeing the solutions created by other people, I found that they don't allow the user to input <i>how sad</i> they feel, or <i>how happy</i> they feel. People often feel a range of emotions, and the intensity felt for each emotions often varies aswell.
Therefore, I wanted to build on this concept of allowing users to log their emotions, but also how intense they feel it.
