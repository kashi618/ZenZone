        <h2>Evaluation of Project and Requirements of the Brief</h2>
            <p>
                The context and requirements of this brief was to use find a way to "identify a situation where computer science can be applied to
enhance some aspect of health and wellbeing in peopleâ€™s lives".
                This project centered around mental health, and allows the user to control their emotion easily.
            </p>

        <h2>Evaluation of Project and Needs of the End User</h2>
            <p>
                I believe that the microbit is very user friendly. 
                I wanted to make the microbit very easy to use, and to also include alot of feedback sounds such as beeps and tings.
                This would increase the user experience, and make them want to continue using it.
                <br>
                The microbit also meets the needs of the end user. 
                All the functionality I brainstormed during the first few weeks were implemented.
                Such as inputting the emotions felt, and the intensity of the emotions felt.
                From these data gathered, a graph could then be formed for the end user to track their emotion throughout the day.

            </p>
        
        <h2>Evaluation of Further Improvents</h2>
            <p>
                One major thing I could improve on is the button A and button B functionality. 
                I spent many days working this out, yet I am still unhappy with out it turned out.
                Although I found my own solution to this problem, I want to revisit this at a later stage and optimise it further.
                <br>
                Another thing I could improve on is my time management.
                I did not account for the length that the create stage would take.
                I estimated it to take around 2ish weeks, however it took almost double the time.
                This was mainly because as I was coding the microbit, many new ideas formed.
                I wanted to implement too much new ideas, which would inevitably lead to many distractions.
