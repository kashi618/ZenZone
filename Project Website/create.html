        <h2>Unit Testing/Bug Testing</h2>
            <p>
                When I was uploading and designing the code to the microbit, I would often encounter many problems.
                Thus, I decided to implement unit testing as many bugs.
                Unit testing is when sections of the code are tested, to help identify bugs and issues early on.
                Although unit testing is very time consuming, it helped this project massively.
                Many of the bugs were encountered early on, and reduced the amount of problems that would arise.
                It helped optimise my code, and to fix the occasional missing brackets or mistyped variable name
            </p>

        <h2>Problems Encountered</h2>
            <p>
                The first problem I encountered when coding the microbit was the scrolling Button A and Button B functionality. 
                I wanted to create a way for the user to cycle between the options there were given, such as the emotions "good","neutral","bad".
                Button A would cycle through the options clockwise. Whilst button B would cycle through the options counter clockwise as shown in the picture below.
            </p>
            <img src="buttonAbuttonB.png" width="600">
            <p>
                This seemingly simple function caused alot of headache, and many days were wasted trying to find a solution.
                One technique I used to help counteract this problem was with abstraction.
                I broke down the function to its core components, and realised I could make a variable to store the "currentChoice", and to give each emotion a number.
                Such as having "bad" = 0, "neutral" = 1, and "happy" = 2.
                By assigning a numerical value to these emotions, I could increase the "currentChoice" by 1 using button A, to change the value from bad to neutral, or from neutral to happy.
                The opposite can be done of button B, which would decrease the "currnetChoice"
                For example, if the "currentChoice" is 2 which represents "happy", I could change it to "neutral" just by decreasing it by -1, changing the "currentChoice" to a 1, which represents "neutral".
            </p>

            <p>
                This is the final iteration of the code I came up with. I believe that it is extremely overcomplicated and over-engineered.
                I hope to revisit this problem in the future, to see if I am able to make it more elegant, and optimise it more.
            </p>

        <h2>Vital Piece of Code</h2>
        <P>
            My most vital piece of code would be when the microbit is logging and exporting the data into a CSV file.
        </P>
        <img src="vitalCode.png" width="600">
        <p>
            This piece of code is very simple, however it is the most important. It is a function which takes in the "emotion" felt, and the "intensity".
            Once the user finishes answering the questions given by the microbit, they simply plug in the usb and tap the logo.
            This will store all the data gathered, and logs them to a CSV file. 
            After, the python script can be run, which reads this CSV file directly from the microbit, graphs the data, and shows the 'what if' questions.
            Lines 10 and onwards calls the "upArrow()" function, which is an animation I created which depicts an arrow sending data to the computer.
