        <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>
                I started by first creating a brainstorm of possible ideas I can build on, and to research on current already existing designs.
                This was done as I could gain inspiration on what I could possibly do.
            </p>

        <h3>Brainstorm</h3>
            <b>Step Tracker for Weight Loss (REJECTED)</b>
        <br>
            Using the microbit, you can track your steps as you visit places such as the journey to the school.
            From the steps gathered, It can calculate the amount of calories lost. 
            It can possible be used for weight loss, telling you how much more you need to walk to achieve your desired weight.
        <br>
            <b>Pros:</b>
                <li>Can help improve self confidence</li>
                <li>Can ensure that the end user gets regular exercise</li>
            <b>Cons:</b>
            <li>The sensor on the microbit is a bit dodgy at times</li>
            <li>Weight loss also depends on many other factors, such as lifestyle and eating habits</li>
        <br><br>
            <b>Heartrate Monitor/Anxiety reliever (REJECTED)</b>
        <br>
            Anxiety is often related to a spiked or higher than normal heart rate due to the adrenaline rush. 
            Users who are prone to anxiety can use the microbit to calculate their heartrate. 
            The microbit can then tell them ways to calm themselves down if their heartrate is above average.
        <br>
            <b>Pros:</b>
                <li>Can find heartrate of end user</li>
                <li>Can help end user calm down during anxiety inducing moments.</li>
            <b>Cons:</b>
                <li>Calculating the heartrate on the microbit is very difficult</li>
                <li>If the user has an anxiety attack, they might even forget to use the microbit, as it would be the last thing on their mind.</li>
        <br><br>
            <b>Emotional Regulator (ACCEPTED)</b> 
        <br>
            1 in 5 people struggle with either managing their emotions, or have mental health issues.
            Using the microbit, this can help users log how they feel. 
            By doing this, users can then look back and get a deeper understanding of themselves and their emotions.
        <br>
            <b>Pros:</b>
                <li>Can help log the end user's emotions</li>
                <li>By using a graph, the user can see how their mood varies thoughout the day</li>
            <b>Cons:</b>
                <li>Due to the amount of emotions, selecting which emotions to include may be difficult</li>
                <li>Graphing the emotions for analysis may also be difficult</li>

            <p>
                From the solutions found online, many of them allow the user to log the emotions they feel.
                I wanted to build on this concept. 
                I wanted to allow the user to not only log their emotions, but see how their mood changed throughout the day. 
                This could possibly be done by asking the user to first log their emotions at certain timestamps throughout the day.
                Then, a python script can graph these emotions.
                However, to do this i needed to interview with potential end users, to also see how often people change their emotions.
                <br><br>
                I also wanted to allow the user to input "how intense" they feel that certain emotion. 
                This is because the user might vary on the intensity of the emotion felt.
                For example, sometimes they might feel very very happy, whilst sometimes they might only feel a slightly happy.
            </p>

        <h3>Interviews with Potential Endusers</h3>

                <b>How long do these emotions often last? (eg. >1 hour, 1-2 hours, 3+ hours)</b>
