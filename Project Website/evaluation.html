        <h2>Evaluation of the Project and Requirements of the Brief</h2>
            <p>
                The context and requirements of this brief was to find a way to "identify a situation where computer science can be applied to enhance some aspect of health and wellbeing in peopleâ€™s lives".
                The completed project follows this as it helps the user to log their emotions, and allows them to improve their mental health.
            </p>

        <h2>Evaluation of the Project and Needs of the End User</h2>
            <p>
                I tried to make the microbit very user friendly. 
                I wanted the microbit to be very easy to use, and to also include alot of feedback sounds such as beeps and tings.
                This would increase the user experience, and make them want to continue using it.
                <br>
                The microbit also meets the needs of the end user. 
                All the functionality I brainstormed during the first few weeks were implemented.
                Such as inputting the emotions felt, and the intensity of the emotions felt.
                Graphing the dataset gathered from the user also turned out great, as the user can use this graph to see how their mood varies throughout the day.
            </p>
        
        <h2>Evaluation on Further Improvents</h2>
            <p>
                One major thing I could improve on is the button A and button B functionality. 
                I spent many days working this out, and I am still unhappy with out it turned out.
                Although I found my own solution to this problem, I want to revisit this in the future to improve and optimise it.
                <br>
                Another thing I could improve on is my time management.
                I did not account for the length that the create stage would take.
                I estimated it to take around 2-ish weeks, however it took almost double the time.
                This was mainly because as I was coding the microbit, many new ideas formed.
                I wanted to implement too much new ideas, which would inevitably lead to many distractions.
