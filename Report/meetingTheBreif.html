                    <li>Microbit leds, for displaying user choice.</li>

            <h3>Storing and Validating the Data</h3>
                <p>
                    When the mood and mood intensity is gathered from the user, it is first validated. 
                    This is done by converting the 'emotion' value to a string, and checking if it contains 'happy', 'sad', or 'neutral'.
                    Then, the "intensity" value to an integer. It is validated by checking if it is between the values of -5 to 5.
                    The validated values is then formatted, and sent to be stored on a CSV file on the microbit.
                </p>
        
        <h2>Meeting the Basic Requirement 3</h2>
            <h3>Analysis Component</h3>
                <p>
                    From the dataset generated by the user, they can then use the python script to the automatically compile and graph the data from the dataset.
                    The x-axis is the time from morning to night in hours, and the y-axis is the general mood level.
                    From this graph, the user can analyise and see how their emotions varies throughout the day.
                </p>
                
        <h2>Meeting the Advanced Requirement 1</h2>
            <p>
                A python script will be used to answer the two 'what if' questions. It will also display the general emotional state, and then graph it.
            </p>

            <h3>What if Questions</h3>
                <p>Q1) How does my mood vary thoughout the day?</p>
                <p>Q2) If I was very sad in the morning, will it affect my general mood level?</p>


        <h2>Meeting the Advanced Requirement 2</h2>
            <h3>Validated Parameters</h3>
            <p>
                Each of the 'What If' questions features 3 validated parameters.
                <li>The emotions 'happy', 'sad', 'neutral' stored as a list.</li>
                <li>The intensity of the emotions, stored as an integer.</li>
                <li>The time each emotion was set, stored as an integer.</li>
                <li>The general emotional state, stored as an integer.</li>
            </p>

        <h3>Validated Parameters</h3>
            <p>
                From the dataset generated by the user, the user will use a python script to automatically compile and plot the data from the dataset.
                The data will then be graphed. The x-axis being the time from morning to night, and the y-axis as the general mood level.
