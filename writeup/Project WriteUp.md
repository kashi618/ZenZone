### Brief
It is estimated that 1 in 5 men and women struggle with depression and mental issues alone. For my Leaving Cert 2024 computer science project, I was assigned to create a "practical technological solution to problems relating to wellbeing". I wanted a way for people to log their feelings, and be able to look back on how they felt. By doing this, the user can get a deeper understanding of themselves.



This microbit project allows an end-uster to input feelings and emotions felt periodically through out the day. From the data gathered, it can then be graphed to see the 



### Basic Requirements
**Create a fully automated embedded system that utilises digital/analogue inputs and digital/analogue outputs to support the theme of wellbeing.**
For my fully automated embedded system, I will use the Microbit with the Micropython software. I used Micropython with the Microbit as it was heavily documented, and contained more features. Users will be able to use many of the different analogue inputs present on the Microbit. (A+B buttons, Logo press, Shake, etc).


**Validate and store the data gathered from the embedded system.**
A dataset on how the end user is feeling (happy, neutral, sad), and how strongly they feel (1-5) will be gathered on the Microbit. This will be done by asking the user two questions; how they feel, and how strongly they feel that way. This will be done on a periodic basis, around every 1-3 hours. The data will then be stored in a csv file in the microbit for user later.


**Create an analysis component that can be used to calculate or predict certain information and inform future decisions relating to wellbeing.**
From the csv file generated in the microbit, a graph can be created for each of the emotions felt by the user. This can then be plotted to see the intensity of each of the emotins felt by the user.




### Advanced Requirements
**Using Python and/or JavaScript, create a computer model based on your own personally created dataset of wellbeing data or one that you have sourced externally. Your personal dataset could be generated manually, programmatically, or by the embedded system. The dataset should contain multiple descriptive features of wellbeing and the model should be capable of answering a minimum of two "what if"" type questions.**



**Each "what if" questions must use a minimum of three validated parameters (using at least two different data types) and, based on the information provided, offer the user insights in relation to some aspect of their wellbeing.**
- How does the mood vary throughout the day?
	Are you more happy in the mornings, sad at night, etc
- What if I feel very happy in the morning, how likely will I continue to be happy throughout the day
- Does an intense mood such as being "very happy" affect the next mood felt in an hour?
	What if i feel 5happy, what is the most likely next emotion?



**Users can view data in a graphical format which displays information such as their progress using the system or the results of a "what if" scenario**



## Investigation
### Research
I started by researching on current existing designs, to see what ideas were already available, and to gain inspiration for my own.

### Brainstorm
After seeing the solutions created by other people, I found that they don't allow the user to input *how sad* they feel, or *how happy* they feel. People often feel a range of emotions, and the intensity felt for each emotions often varies aswell.
Therefore, I wanted to build on this concept of allowing users to log their emotions, but also how intense they feel it.

### Feedback from Potential End-Users
How often do you change emotions? (eg. from happy to sad)
subject1 - often, every hour

subject2 - very rarely, 2 hours

subject3 - frequenty, hourly

subject4 - autistic, every 10 minutes or 5 hours

subject5 - pretty often, 1hour 20mins

subject6 -
