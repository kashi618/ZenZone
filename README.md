**Hi, welcome to my Computer Science Coursework project for the Leaving Certificate 2024.**

For this years brief, I was tasked to "identify a situation where computer science can be applied to enhance some aspect of health and wellbeing in peopleâ€™s lives".
The specific tasks where to:
  1) Create an embedded system that can be used to enhance some aspect of wellbeing.
  2) Use the computer model to provide insights into some aspect of wellbeing.

I decided to make a tracker for mental health. It tracks the emotions felt by the user throughout the day. At the end of the day, the data gathered can be used for analysis to see how their mood would vary.

- Everything I have done in this project has been documented and explained in my website, which you can access by **[Clicking Here!](https://kashi618.github.io/ZenZone/)**
- All of the code written for the Microbit and the dataset gathered can be found in the "artefect" folder. In this folder, you will also find the "Python Script.py" file, which is used to graph and analyse their mood.

PS: *Yes, I spelt the word "brief" wrong on the website. And yes, that was the one submitted to the state exams.* :D
